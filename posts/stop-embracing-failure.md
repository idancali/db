## Stop Embracing Failure.
#### No One Likes Getting Punched In The Face.

The whole concept of embracing failure is ridiculous. Let’s be honest. No one likes failure.

The idea here is to fail less by not repeating the same mistakes.

But not that failure is this great thing we all need to start liking all of a sudden.

Because that’s what it sounds like to me, namely, that we should embrace getting punched in the face. We’re being flooded with the silly notion that we should start liking failure. And that’s just plain ridiculous.

The problem with attempting to like failure is that we become desensitised to it. And people who are desensitised do not feel. And people who don’t feel are poor learners. Why? Because feeling burns new knowledge into our brains.

So embracing failure is a bad idea because it ends up making us poor learners. What a paradox, though. We’re being told we should embrace failure in order to learn, but the reality is quite contrary.

Look. It’s like going to Rocky Balboa and telling him to embrace every punch he receives in the face.

That’s just stupid.

Yeah, Rocky took a lot of punches in the face, and he could take them, but I’m sure he didn’t like them. The smart thing to say to Rocky would be:

> Bro, just move your head out of the way more often and you’ll get hit less.

In other words, instead of embracing failure — like it’s a good thing, we need to first develop endurance to it — like it’s a bad thing.

How? Just like Rocky did and just like any athlete and just like anyone does — by training hard.

Spreading the notion of embracing failure is like telling Rocky to get stronger and stronger so that he can take more punches.

No. What we need to do is to move beyond enduring failure, which is a good first step, but not enough. Moving beyond means getting smarter and starting to hate failure, so badly, that your brain starts thinking up new ways to avoid it.

If Rocky were smarter and really hated getting punched in the face, he would’ve probably moved his head more often. But see, that’s the problem. Someone must’ve told him to embrace punching — so the poor dude did.

Now go off and stop embracing failure but first build endurance to it, meaning don’t cry about it — move on. And secondly, start hating it with passion so that your brain gets into that super creative, fluid state, where it will come up with solutions on its own.

After all, necessity is the mother of (most) inventions so get yourself into a necessity-like state by truly not embracing failure but quite the opposite.
