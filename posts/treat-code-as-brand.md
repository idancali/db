## Treat Code As An Integral Part Of Your Brand

### Can Marketing Teach Us Anything About The Developer Experience?

Yes. I believe it can.

I talk a lot about the creative side of software development. How it’s closer to art than science. It’s rather hard to put that into perspective but here’s an attempt to do just that.

Let’s talk about how code is designed.

It’s rather common to discuss code architecture but we don’t think about the need to design code as much. We have specialists in User Experience (UX) and we have specialists in Customer Experience (CX) but when it comes to the Development Experience, we don’t have the luxury of an abundance of DX specialists.

That’s unfortunate but I think it’s due to the fact that we rarely think about the need to address the Developer Experience. And that has lasting effects on our products and ultimately on our businesses. Because let’s be honest, developers are crucial to product development. When you think about it it’s immediately obvious. Products are as good as the developers building them. But in practice we tend to overlook this and so we invest in sales and marketing and management and operations and so on while assuming — oh that word — that developers are just fine.

But I’d like to suggest that investing in the Developer Experience up front is one of the greatest investments you can make as a Product Owner/Manager.

And here is one incredibly simple way that you can do that.

Let’s draw from a more familiar context: marketing. Specifically, branding. The process of branding is absolutely crucial. A good brand takes quite a bit of design work and creative thinking. The key focus is on the Customer Experience and more precisely, the customer’s mind. A good brand has to build on pre-existent mental modals that the branding specialist is intimately aware of. A great brand has to fit well in a customer’s mind so that the mind can embrace it and not reject it or worse — ignore it. One practical example is a domain name. If your domain name is 57 letters long, don’t expect your customers to remember it. A good brand designer will minimize the cognitive load required by the brain to process the brand.

Now let’s see what we’d get if we were to apply the same kind of approach to the Developer Experience. In a sense, we can think of the developer as the customer and the software architect as our brand designer. An architect — or code designer — that is sensitive to the Developer Experience will approach code design much like the brand designer approaches branding.

I’m only going to take one concrete example here but if you follow the concept to its logical conclusion, there are a lot of other applications.

Naming variables and classes.

If we were to treat our code as part of the brand, then we would think twice about how we name our variables, classes, packages, etc. A good code designer would invest effort in crafting appropriate names for all the critical parts of the code. Why? Because just like a good brand ‘fits’ well in a customer’s mind, so too good code ‘fits’ better in a developer’s mind. Confusing and messy variable names create a much larger cognitive load.

That means a less delightful Developer Experience and implicitly, worse quality and lower productivity. Simply because a developer would not be free to use most of his mental ability on building the product. Instead his mind will be unnecessarily burdened by the continuous effort to keep a convoluted code model intact in their working memory.

Interrupt such a developer and the work of rebuilding the code model in their active working memory starts from scratch.

But that’s for another article altogether.

This is slightly more than theoretical. I have tried it in my own code. I noticed that if spend quality time on naming my code fragments upfront I save massive amounts of time long term. I can go back to an old piece of code and I can build a mental model of the code in seconds rather than minutes (or hours).

You can think of it as loading code into your brain.

And you can think of the time it takes to do that as the critical metric when measuring development productivity.

Go ahead and approach code design as a branding exercise and watch your development productivity soar.

Trust me.
